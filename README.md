# face-fingerprint-semantic-gap
An experimental research project demonstrating the limitations of cross-modal metric learning. Using a Dual-ResNet Siamese architecture and Contrastive Loss, this project mathematically proves the "Semantic Gap" and why biologically uncorrelated modalities (faces and fingerprints) cannot be mapped to a shared embedding space.
